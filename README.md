This repository contains solutions to the ALX printf team project carried out by Gaius Afuaman and Chiamaka Anachusi

[GENERAL REQUIREMENT](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/228)
~ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
~ All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc.
~ All your files should end with a new line.
~ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
~ Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
~ You are not allowed to use global variables.
~ No more than 5 functions per file.
~ The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
~ Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded.

[DESCRIPTION](https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/stdio.h/printf)
In C programming, printf functions (which stands for "print formatted") is used for output. They accept a string parameter called the format string, which specifies a method for rendering an arbitrary number of varied data type parameter(s) into a string. This string is then by default printed on the standard output stream, but variants exist that perform other tasks with the result.

[PROTOTYPE](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/228)
int _ printf(const char * format, ...)

[COMPILATION](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/228)
Your code will be compiled this way:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
